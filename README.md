A cutting-edge, deep learning-powered repository for fingerprint detection in images and videos, built for applications in real-time biometric security, forensic analysis, and human-computer interaction. This framework combines speed and accuracy to achieve high precision in challenging, real-world conditions. 

## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements a **bounding-box-based** detection framework that surpasses traditional minutiae-based fingerprint detection in speed and reliability. We evaluate state-of-the-art detection models like YOLOv10, YOLOv11, RT-DETR, RetinaNet, and EfficientDet for their efficacy in fingerprint localization across diverse image and video contexts.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **🔍 Advanced Model Selection**: Includes optimized YOLO-based and transformer-based architectures tailored for high-speed, real-time detection.
- **📊 Extensive Dataset**: Utilizes over **23,000 images** from Roboflow, Open Images, and other biometric sources, ensuring robust fingerprint detection across various hand poses, lighting conditions, and resolutions.
- **🔄 Data Augmentation & Annotation**: Enhanced data augmentation and complex annotation methods to ensure model robustness in real-world environments.
- **📈 Performance Metrics & Analysis**: Detailed model evaluation based on mAP, AR, IoU, and other metrics, with a specific focus on real-time fingerprint detection applications.
- **🔮 Future Directions**: Proposes a hybrid detection approach for even greater efficiency in fingerprint detection.

## ⚙️ Applications

This repository supports a wide range of real-world applications:

- **🔐 Biometric Security**: Fast and accurate fingerprint recognition for authentication systems.
- **🔍 Forensic Analysis**: Automated fingerprint detection in static images and dynamic video frames, ideal for forensic investigations.
- **🤖 Human-Computer Interaction**: Enables interaction-based applications where fingerprint detection is a crucial component.

## 📊 Performance Evaluation

Our framework uses standard object detection metrics for evaluation:
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision)** and **AR (Average Recall)** at multiple IoU thresholds
- Evaluation across small, medium, and large object scales to ensure accuracy in diverse image conditions

## 🔄 Future Directions

To enhance fingerprint detection, we propose a **hybrid approach** combining dedicated hand detection with fingerprint identification within localized regions of interest. Further improvements include:
- **Transfer Learning** and **Synthetic Data Generation** for greater generalization
- **Real-World Deployment** and extensive field testing for scalability
